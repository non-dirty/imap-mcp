## Transition Verification

To verify all tasks have been properly migrated:

1. **Issue Count Check**:
   - Expected number of issues: 11 (from task table)
   - Actual number of issues: 14 (verified in GitHub)

2. **Coverage Tasks**:
   - Number of modules below 90% coverage: (from running script)
   - Number of coverage tasks created: (verify in GitHub)

3. **Issue Properties**:
   - All issues have proper priority labels
   - All issues have proper status labels
   - All issues contain full task descriptions

## Next Steps

After completing the current issues (#10-#14), the GitHub Integration process will be complete. Then we can continue with the regular task workflow.

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check GitHub issues
gh issue list --repo non-dirty/imap-mcp

# Run code coverage
uv run -m pytest --cov=imap_mcp --cov-report=term

# Verify GitHub project board
gh project view --owner non-dirty --repo imap-mcp
```

This document serves as a reference for the transition process and verification.
