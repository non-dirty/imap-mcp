# AI-Assisted Development Workflow

This document outlines the workflow for using AI assistants (like Claude Sonnet) with GitHub Issues to autonomously develop features for the IMAP MCP project.

## Overview

The integration of AI assistants with GitHub Issues provides an autonomous development system that:
- Prioritizes work through GitHub Issues
- Maintains consistent development patterns
- Enforces quality through automated testing
- Preserves institutional knowledge in issue history
- Reduces manual overhead in development

## Autonomous Feature Development Process

### 1. Task Planning & Creation

AI assistants can participate in task planning by:
- Analyzing existing codebase and identifying improvement opportunities
- Creating issues with appropriate priority and status labels:
  ```bash
  gh issue create --title "New Feature Name" --body "Detailed description..." --label "priority:X" --label "status:prioritized"
  ```
- Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-issues
- Linking related issues together with references

### 2. Feature Implementation

When starting work on an issue:
```bash
# Check current status
python scripts/issue_helper.py check <issue-number>

# Start work on the issue (creates branch, updates status)
python scripts/issue_helper.py start <issue-number>
```

This workflow automatically:
- Creates a feature branch with appropriate naming
- Updates issue status to `in-progress`
- Links commits to the issue for traceability

### 3. Test-Driven Development

AI assistants should follow TDD practices:
1. Write tests that cover the expected functionality
2. Run tests to verify they fail appropriately
3. Implement features to make tests pass
4. Refactor while maintaining test success

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=imap_mcp
```

### 4. Pull Request Creation

When implementation is complete:
```bash
# Complete the issue (creates PR, links issue)
python scripts/issue_helper.py complete <issue-number>
```

This automatically:
- Creates a pull request linked to the issue
- Includes issue references in the PR description
- Updates issue status to `in-review`

### 5. Code Integration

Once PR checks pass and reviews are completed:
```bash
# Merge the PR
gh pr merge <pr-number>
```

This triggers workflows that:
- Merge the changes into the main branch
- Update issue status to `completed`
- Reorganize priorities of remaining issues if appropriate

## Benefits for AI Development

### Reduced Context Window Usage

By leveraging GitHub Issues instead of in-chat task lists:
- Each feature can be developed with focused context
- Issue details provide precise requirements without needing to remember all project details
- Issue references create implicit links between related features

### Improved Output Consistency

The standardized workflow ensures:
- Uniform code style and patterns across features
- Consistent test coverage and quality standards
- Reliable commit message formats that trigger appropriate status transitions

### Enhanced Collaboration

AI assistants can collaborate with human developers through:
- Issue comments for progress updates and clarifications
- PR reviews for feedback and improvements
- Status transitions that keep everyone informed

## Automated Validation

The status updater script ensures issues accurately reflect development status:
```bash
python scripts/issue_status_updater.py --owner <repo-owner> --repo <repo-name> --issue <issue-number>
```

This script can be run:
- Locally by developers or AI assistants
- Automatically through GitHub Actions on commits and PR events
- As part of a scheduled validation process

## Success Metrics

Autonomous development success can be measured by:
- Percentage of issues completed with minimal human intervention
- Test coverage maintained across features
- Frequency of status transitions indicating steady progress
- Reduction in time from issue creation to completion

## Continuous Improvement

Through the issue history, the system accumulates knowledge about:
- Which development patterns lead to successful implementations
- Common challenges and their solutions
- Optimal task sizing for AI development
- Patterns that could benefit from additional automation
