# IMAP MCP Server Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the detailed tasks required to complete and enhance the IMAP MCP Server implementation using a test-driven development (TDD) approach. Tasks are sequenced for incremental progress with maximum chance of success.

## Task Workflow for Claude

When working on a task from this list, follow these steps:

1. **Task Analysis**:
   - First, carefully read and understand the task requirements
   - Determine if the task needs to be broken down into smaller subtasks
   - If needed, update TASKS.md with the subtask breakdown

2. **Task Status Update**:
   - Update the task's status in the Task Tracker table to "started"
   - Commit this change before beginning implementation

3. **Test-Driven Development**:
   - Write test specifications first before implementation
   - Create failing tests that verify the desired functionality
   - Implement the feature until all tests pass
   - Refactor the code while ensuring tests continue to pass
   - Run the full test suite to check for regressions

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update docstrings and comments in the implementation
   - Add any necessary examples or usage instructions to README.md
   - If adding new commands or processes, update CLAUDE.md accordingly

5. **Task Completion**:
   - Change the task's status to "completed" in the Task Tracker
   - Change the task's priority to "-" in the Task Tracker (indicating no priority for completed tasks)
   - Move the task details from TASKS.md to TASKS_COMPLETED.md
   - Add a detailed summary of what was accomplished under the task in TASKS_COMPLETED.md
   - Do NOT renumber the tasks in TASKS.md - maintain their original numbers

6. **Priority Reassessment**:
   - After completing a task, reassess priorities for remaining tasks
   - Update the priority numbers in the Task Tracker as appropriate
   - Ensure at least one remaining task has priority 1
   - Priorities should be sequential starting from 1 with no gaps
   - Document the reasoning for any priority changes in a git commit message

7. **Commit Changes**:
   - Create a git commit with a descriptive message
   - Include the task number and name in the commit message
   - Push the changes to GitHub

## Task Status Definitions

Tasks in the Task Tracker can have the following statuses:

- **proposed**: Initial idea for a task, not yet fully defined
- **defined**: Task has been specified but not yet prioritized
- **prioritized**: Task has been assigned a priority number
- **started**: Work on the task has begun
- **completed**: Implementation is finished and passes all tests
- **reviewed**: Task has been reviewed by another contributor
- **archived**: Task has been moved to TASKS_COMPLETED.md

## Test-Driven Development Approach

For each task:

1. **Write test specifications first** - Define what successful implementation looks like
2. **Create failing tests** - Implement tests that verify the desired functionality (which should fail initially)
3. **Implement the feature** - Write code until all tests pass
4. **Refactor** - Clean up the implementation without breaking tests
5. **Verify** - Run all existing tests to ensure no regression

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests for a specific module
pytest tests/test_module_name.py

# Run tests with coverage report

2. Research potential conflicts between pip and uv
3. Examine any file copy operations during package installation
4. Review naming and versioning handling in the virtual environment
5. Check for race conditions in concurrent installations

**Expected Outcome**:
