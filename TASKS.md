# IMAP MCP Server Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the detailed tasks required to complete and enhance the IMAP MCP Server implementation. Each task includes a specific prompt that can be used with Claude or another AI assistant to accomplish the task.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Implement Learning Layer

**Task Name**: Design and implement learning layer

**Prompt for Claude**:
```
I want to implement the learning layer for the imap-mcp server as described in the README. This component should record and analyze user decisions to predict future actions. Please:

1. Design the learning layer architecture:
   - Data model for storing user interactions and decisions
   - Feature extraction from emails and user actions
   - Prediction mechanisms for suggesting future actions
2. Implement the learning layer code:
   - Create a new module `imap_mcp/learning.py`
   - Implement classes and functions for tracking user decisions
   - Add simple prediction capabilities based on historical actions
3. Integrate with existing components:
   - Update resources.py and tools.py to connect with the learning layer
   - Modify server.py to initialize and manage the learning layer

Focus on a simple but effective implementation that can learn from how I process emails over time.
```

### 2. Improve Test Coverage

**Task Name**: Expand test suite

**Prompt for Claude**:
```
The current test coverage for the imap-mcp repository is limited to just testing the models. I need help expanding the test suite to cover more components. Please:

1. Analyze the current test file (tests/test_models.py) to understand the testing approach
2. Create new test files for other major components:
   - tests/test_config.py for configuration handling
   - tests/test_imap_client.py for IMAP client functionality
   - tests/test_resources.py for MCP resources
   - tests/test_tools.py for MCP tools
   - tests/test_server.py for server functionality
3. Implement mock-based tests that don't require an actual IMAP server
4. Add integration tests that can optionally connect to a real server when credentials are available

Each test file should include both simple unit tests and more complex integration scenarios.
```

### 3. Add Email Processing Workflow

**Task Name**: Implement interactive email processing workflow

**Prompt for Claude**:
```
I want to implement a structured workflow for processing emails and learning my preferences. This should guide Claude through processing each email with me. Please:

   - User interaction patterns for different email types
   - Action recording and feedback mechanisms
2. Implement the workflow code:
   - Create necessary classes and functions
   - Add state management
   - Implement user interaction prompts and responses
3. Integrate with existing components:
   - Update resources.py and tools.py to support the workflow
   - Connect with the learning layer for recording decisions
   - Add workflow initialization to server.py

The workflow should be intuitive and adaptable to different email types and user preferences.
```

### 4. Create Documentation

**Task Name**: Generate comprehensive documentation

**Prompt for Claude**:
```
I need to create comprehensive documentation for the imap-mcp project. Please help me:

   - Usage examples
   - Workflow guide for email processing
   - Security considerations
3. Update docstrings throughout the codebase to ensure they're informative and consistent
4. Create a simple build process for the documentation

The documentation should be clear, comprehensive, and help both users and developers understand how to use and extend the system.
```

### 5. Containerize the Application

**Task Name**: Add Docker support

**Prompt for Claude**:
```
I want to containerize the imap-mcp application for easier deployment. Please help me:

1. Create Docker configuration:
   - Write a Dockerfile optimized for Python applications
   - Set up appropriate base image, dependencies, and environment
   - Configure the container to run the MCP server
2. Add docker-compose support:
   - Create a docker-compose.yml file
   - Configure services, volumes, and environment variables
3. Write documentation on:
   - Building the Docker image
   - Running the container
   - Managing configuration within the Docker environment
4. Include security best practices for containerizing an application that handles email credentials

The Docker setup should make it easy to deploy and run the application in various environments.
```

### 6. Test with Real Email Account

**Task Name**: End-to-end testing with a real email account

**Prompt for Claude**:
```
I want to perform an end-to-end test of the imap-mcp server with a real email account. Please help me:

1. Create a test plan:
   - List of test scenarios covering different email operations
   - Expected behaviors for each test
   - Success criteria
2. Guide me through setup:
   - Configuration for a test email account
   - Server startup and connection verification
3. Execute test scenarios:
   - Browsing email folders
   - Searching for specific emails
   - Reading email content
   - Performing actions (mark as read, move, delete)
   - Testing the learning capabilities if implemented
4. Document results and any issues encountered

We'll use a test email account to avoid any risk to important emails, focusing on verifying that the core functionality works correctly.
```

### 7. Implement Multi-Account Support

**Task Name**: Add support for multiple email accounts

**Prompt for Claude**:
```
I want to enhance the imap-mcp server to support multiple email accounts simultaneously. Please help me:
