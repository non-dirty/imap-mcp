Testing Automated Status Workflow - issue #16:

Step 1: Create a Test Issue
Let's create a simple test issue to verify our automated workflow:

bash
CopyInsert in Terminal
gh issue create --title "Test Automated Status Workflow" --body "This is a test issue to verify that our automated status updates are working correctly." --label "status:prioritized" --label "priority:3"
This command will create a new issue with:

A descriptive title
A simple description
The initial "prioritized" status
A lower priority (3) to avoid interfering with real work
Feel free to try this command and let me know if you encounter any errors!

Step 2: Make Changes and Reference the Issue
Once you have your test issue (let's say it's issue #16 for this example), create a branch for it:

bash
CopyInsert in Terminal
git checkout -b test/issue-16-workflow-test
Now, make a simple change (or an empty commit) that references the issue:

bash
CopyInsert
# Make a small change to a file and commit
git add tests/issue_test_log.txt
git commit -m "refs #16: added issues_test_log with the instructions I'm following for this test"
Note: When referencing an issue in your commit message, use one of the following formats:
- refs #16
- implements #16
- fixes #16
- closes #16
Avoid using a colon after "refs", as it may cause the automation to fail.

Then push your branch:

bash
CopyInsert in Terminal
git push -u origin test/issue-16-workflow-test
Step 3: Create a Pull Request
Now create a pull request that references the issue:

bash
CopyInsert in Terminal
gh pr create --title "Test PR for issue #16" --body "This PR tests the automated status updates. Closes #16" --base main
This will:

Create a PR referencing issue #16
Include "Closes #16" to ensure the issue is closed when merged
Set the base branch to main
Step 4: Monitor Status Changes
After each step, you can check the issue's status using:

bash
CopyInsert in Terminal
gh issue view 16 --json labels
You should see:

After your first commit: status changes to "in-progress"
After creating the PR: status changes to "in-review"
After merging the PR: status changes to "completed"
What to Watch For
As you go through these steps, pay attention to:

GitHub Actions logs (visible in the Actions tab of your repository)
Comments added to the issue by the automation
Status label changes on the issue
Any errors that might appear
Let me know if you encounter any issues or have questions as you go through these steps!

## Issue Status Workflow Test - Run 2

After making fixes to the workflow file and the commit message parser, we're running another test.

### Step 1: Update the commit message parser
Made the script more robust to handle variations in commit message format:
- Updated regex patterns to allow optional colons after action keywords (e.g., `refs: #16`)
- Added better spacing handling in the regex patterns

### Step 2: Make test commit with proper format
```bash
git add scripts/issue_status_updater.py tests/issue_test_log.txt
git commit -m "refs #16 Made commit message parser more robust"
```

### Step 3: Push changes
```bash
git push
```

### Step 4: Observe workflow run
- Check GitHub Actions tab to see if the workflow runs successfully
- Verify that the issue status is updated to "in-progress"

### Notes:
The parser now handles these formats:
- `refs #16`
- `refs: #16` 
- `implements #16`
- `implements: #16`
- `fixes #16`
- `fixes: #16`
- `closes #16`
- `closes: #16`
