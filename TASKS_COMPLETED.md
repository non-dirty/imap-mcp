# Completed Implementation Tasks

## 1. Enhance Test Infrastructure

**Task Name**: Set up comprehensive test infrastructure

**Test Specifications**:
- Test fixtures for mocking IMAP connections
- Utilities for creating test email data
- Configuration for running both unit and integration tests
- Test coverage reporting configuration

**Implementation Steps**:
```
1. First analyze the current test setup in tests/test_models.py
2. Create a tests/conftest.py file with:
   - IMAP mock fixtures
   - Test email data generators
   - Configuration fixtures
3. Implement a test_utils.py module with helper functions
4. Configure pytest.ini for proper test organization
5. Set up coverage reporting configuration
```

**TDD Process**:
1. Create empty test files with expected test functions (they should fail)
2. Implement the test infrastructure code until tests pass
3. Run `pytest --cov=imap_mcp tests/test_infrastructure.py` to verify

**Accomplishments**:

1. Created a comprehensive set of test fixtures in conftest.py including:
   - Mock IMAP client fixtures
   - Email message fixtures (simple, multipart, with attachments, encoded headers)
   - Email model fixtures
   - Environment configuration fixtures

2. Implemented test utility functions in test_utils.py including:
   - Random data generation for testing
   - Email message creation helpers
   - Email comparison utilities
   - Mock IMAP folder list creation

3. Created test_infrastructure.py to validate the infrastructure itself, ensuring all fixtures and utilities work as expected

4. Fixed bugs in the EmailAddress.parse method to correctly handle edge cases and make existing tests pass

5. Added a pytest.ini file for proper test organization and configuration

6. Created a CLAUDE.md file with build/test commands and code style guidelines for the project

7. Added a comprehensive .gitignore file to exclude temporary and generated files

This test infrastructure provides a solid foundation for implementing the remaining tasks in the project using a test-driven development approach.
