# Completed Implementation Tasks

## 1. Expand Core IMAP Client Tests

**Task Name**: Implement comprehensive IMAP client tests

**Test Specifications**:
- Test connection/disconnection behavior
- Test folder listing functionality
- Test message retrieval with various filters
- Test message action functions (mark read, move, delete)
- Test error handling and edge cases

**Implementation Steps**:
```
1. Create test_imap_client.py with test cases covering:
   - Connection establishment/teardown
   - Authentication methods
   - Folder operations
   - Message retrieval operations
   - Message modification operations
   - Error scenarios and recovery
2. Use mocking to simulate IMAP server responses
3. Include tests for both successful and error conditions
```

**TDD Process**:
1. Run `pytest tests/test_imap_client.py -v` to see all tests fail
2. Fix or implement the functionality in imap_client.py
3. Run tests again until all pass
4. Run `pytest --cov=imap_mcp.imap_client` to verify coverage

**Accomplishments**:

1. Created comprehensive test suite for the IMAP client with 25 test cases covering:
   - Client initialization and configuration
   - Connection and authentication
   - Folder listing and selection
   - Email search functionality
   - Email fetching (single and multiple)
   - Email operations (marking, moving, deleting)
   - Error handling for all operations

2. Achieved 98% test coverage for the IMAP client module

3. Used mock objects to simulate IMAP server responses, allowing tests to run without a real IMAP server

4. Implemented tests for both successful cases and error scenarios to ensure the client is robust

5. Updated project configuration to use Python 3.10+ and configured the environment using `uv` tool

6. Added documentation for using `uv` to manage the project's Python environment

## 0. Enhance Test Infrastructure

**Task Name**: Set up comprehensive test infrastructure

**Test Specifications**:
- Test fixtures for mocking IMAP connections
- Utilities for creating test email data
- Configuration for running both unit and integration tests
- Test coverage reporting configuration

**Implementation Steps**:
```
1. First analyze the current test setup in tests/test_models.py
2. Create a tests/conftest.py file with:
   - IMAP mock fixtures
   - Test email data generators
   - Configuration fixtures
3. Implement a test_utils.py module with helper functions
4. Configure pytest.ini for proper test organization
5. Set up coverage reporting configuration
```

**TDD Process**:
1. Create empty test files with expected test functions (they should fail)
2. Implement the test infrastructure code until tests pass
3. Run `pytest --cov=imap_mcp tests/test_infrastructure.py` to verify

**Accomplishments**:

1. Created a comprehensive set of test fixtures in conftest.py including:
   - Mock IMAP client fixtures
   - Email message fixtures (simple, multipart, with attachments, encoded headers)
   - Email model fixtures
   - Environment configuration fixtures

2. Implemented test utility functions in test_utils.py including:
   - Random data generation for testing
   - Email message creation helpers
   - Email comparison utilities
   - Mock IMAP folder list creation

3. Created test_infrastructure.py to validate the infrastructure itself, ensuring all fixtures and utilities work as expected

4. Fixed bugs in the EmailAddress.parse method to correctly handle edge cases and make existing tests pass

5. Added a pytest.ini file for proper test organization and configuration

6. Created a CLAUDE.md file with build/test commands and code style guidelines for the project

7. Added a comprehensive .gitignore file to exclude temporary and generated files

This test infrastructure provides a solid foundation for implementing the remaining tasks in the project using a test-driven development approach.
