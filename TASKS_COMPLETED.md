**Implementation Steps**:
```
1. Create test_imap_client.py with test cases covering:
   - Connection establishment/teardown
   - Authentication methods
   - Folder operations
   - Message retrieval operations
   - Message modification operations
   - Error scenarios and recovery
2. Use mocking to simulate IMAP server responses
3. Include tests for both successful and error conditions
```

**TDD Process**:
1. Run `pytest tests/test_imap_client.py -v` to see all tests fail
2. Fix or implement the functionality in imap_client.py
3. Run tests again until all pass
4. Run `pytest --cov=imap_mcp.imap_client` to verify coverage

**Accomplishments**:

1. Created comprehensive test suite for the IMAP client with 25 test cases covering:
   - Client initialization and configuration
   - Connection and authentication
   - Folder listing and selection
   - Email search functionality
   - Email fetching (single and multiple)
   - Email operations (marking, moving, deleting)
   - Error handling for all operations

2. Achieved 98% test coverage for the IMAP client module

3. Used mock objects to simulate IMAP server responses, allowing tests to run without a real IMAP server

4. Implemented tests for both successful cases and error scenarios to ensure the client is robust

5. Updated project configuration to use Python 3.10+ and configured the environment using `uv` tool

6. Added documentation for using `uv` to manage the project's Python environment

## 2. Implement Config Module Tests

**Task Name**: Test and enhance configuration handling

**Test Specifications**:
- Test loading configurations from files
- Test environment variable integration
- Test validation of configuration values
- Test default values and fallbacks
- Test error handling for invalid configurations

**Implementation Steps**:
```
1. Create test_config.py with test cases covering:
   - Config file loading
   - Environment variable integration
   - Configuration validation
   - Default values
   - Error handling for invalid configurations
2. Use temporary files and environment variables in tests
```

**TDD Process**:
1. Run `pytest tests/test_config.py -v` to see all tests fail
2. Fix or enhance the config.py module to handle all test cases
3. Run tests again until all pass
4. Run `pytest --cov=imap_mcp.config` to verify coverage

**Accomplishments**:

1. Created comprehensive test suite for the configuration module with 12 test cases covering:
   - ImapConfig class initialization and validation
   - ServerConfig class initialization and validation
   - Loading configuration from YAML files
   - Loading configuration from environment variables
   - Error handling for invalid configurations
   - Default value handling and fallbacks

2. Achieved 100% test coverage for the config module

3. Enhanced the config.py module to handle file not found errors gracefully

4. Added proper environment variable integration tests

5. Implemented thorough validation testing for all configuration components

## 0. Enhance Test Infrastructure

**Task Name**: Set up comprehensive test infrastructure

**Test Specifications**:
- Test fixtures for mocking IMAP connections
- Utilities for creating test email data
- Configuration for running both unit and integration tests
- Test coverage reporting configuration

**Implementation Steps**:
```
1. First analyze the current test setup in tests/test_models.py
2. Create a tests/conftest.py file with:
   - IMAP mock fixtures
   - Test email data generators
   - Configuration fixtures
3. Implement a test_utils.py module with helper functions
4. Configure pytest.ini for proper test organization
5. Set up coverage reporting configuration
```

**TDD Process**:
1. Create empty test files with expected test functions (they should fail)
2. Implement the test infrastructure code until tests pass
3. Run `pytest --cov=imap_mcp tests/test_infrastructure.py` to verify

**Accomplishments**:

1. Created a comprehensive set of test fixtures in conftest.py including:
   - Mock IMAP client fixtures
   - Email message fixtures (simple, multipart, with attachments, encoded headers)
   - Email model fixtures
   - Environment configuration fixtures

2. Implemented test utility functions in test_utils.py including:
   - Random data generation for testing
   - Email message creation helpers
   - Email comparison utilities
   - Mock IMAP folder list creation

3. Created test_infrastructure.py to validate the infrastructure itself, ensuring all fixtures and utilities work as expected

4. Fixed bugs in the EmailAddress.parse method to correctly handle edge cases and make existing tests pass

5. Added a pytest.ini file for proper test organization and configuration

## 3. Implement MCP Resources Tests

**Task Name**: Test and enhance MCP resources

**Test Specifications**:
- Test email resource representation
- Test folder resource representation
- Test resource serialization/deserialization
- Test resource validation
- Test resource error handling

**Implementation Steps**:
```
1. Create test_resources.py with test cases covering:
   - Resource initialization
   - Resource serialization/deserialization
   - Resource validation
   - Resource error handling
2. Mock necessary dependencies
```

**TDD Process**:
1. Run `pytest tests/test_resources.py -v` to see all tests fail
2. Implement or fix resource functionality in resources.py
3. Run tests again until all pass
4. Run `pytest --cov=imap_mcp.resources` to verify coverage

**Accomplishments**:

1. Created a comprehensive test suite for MCP resources in test_resources.py with 7 test cases covering:
   - Client retrieval from context
   - Resource registration with the MCP server
   - Email folders listing functionality
   - Email listing within folders
   - Email search functionality across folders
   - Individual email retrieval by UID
   - Error handling for all resource operations

2. Implemented proper test fixtures for mocking the MCP server and IMAP client

3. Fixed import issues in the resources.py file to correctly import the Context class from mcp.server.fastmcp

4. Achieved 91% test coverage for the resources module

5. Used asyncio test fixtures to properly test asynchronous resource handlers

6. Implemented comprehensive error handling tests to ensure robustness

6. Created a CLAUDE.md file with build/test commands and code style guidelines for the project

7. Added a comprehensive .gitignore file to exclude temporary and generated files

This test infrastructure provides a solid foundation for implementing the remaining tasks in the project using a test-driven development approach.
